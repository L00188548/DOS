# **Cheat Sheet Exercise**

*Steps to complete this exercise & Final grad 10%*
---------------------------------------------------
1. On your computer, create a folder called *DOS*.
2. In my notes, I gave 11 examples previously. You tested these, editing most of them to demonstrate you understood the content. 
3. Save these examples to the folder called *DOS* and create a file *readme.txt* describing your work to a peer. Make this a *GIT* repo on your local machine.  
4. On GITHUB create a PRIVATE repo called DOS with readme.md, a license file and a gitignore and synchronize with your local repo. Give your lecturer access as a contributor. This is worth *10% of your final grade*.
